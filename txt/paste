5 cores per executor
– For max HDFS throughput
• Cluster has 6 * 15 = 90 cores in total (after taking out
Hadoop/Yarn daemon cores)
• 90 cores / 5 cores/executor = 18 executors
• 1 executor for AM => 17 executors
• Each node has 3 executors
• 63 GB/3 = 21 GB, 21 x (1-0.07) ~ 19 GB (counting off
heap overhead)
